TEDx is an independently organized TED event. I worked with a team of around 40 other students to put one of the largest TEDx events, hosting distinguished speakers from DC/Maryland/Virginia area. I worked on the Content team and spent the year searching for speakers and helping them rehearse their speeches for the main event. We also served as liaisons for the speakers and helped them get around DC during their stay in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.
