At GW, I worked under Dr. Lijie Zhang and her team to research the ability of stem cells to adhere and proliferate on 3D printed scaffolds. I was involved with culturing and centrifuging mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and printing the scaffolds using a resin 3D printer. I also redesigned the printing tray which resulted in more consistent scaffolds to test with.

This was my first exposure to research in biomedical engineering. Using the knowlege from my courses as well as my internship at Spine Wave, I was able to get a good grasp of the technologies used and the unique environment of a research lab.
