<br><br>
At FAST Enterprises, I worked directly with the Washington DC Office of Tax and Revenue to implement a new tax management system. We also launched MyTax.DC.gov, a web portal for DC taxpayers to electronically file their taxes online.

I worked on the returns team to design many of the online returns as well as develop software for the client. In my second year I was moved to the production support team, where I helped implement fixes and enhancements to our live software.
