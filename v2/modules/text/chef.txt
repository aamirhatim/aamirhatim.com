<br><br>
In my free time I love to cook, so I took a few part time jobs to get a sense of what it was like to do this as a profession. I was first a cashier, cook and delivery man at a popular GW late night food stop, Crepeaway. I worked the late shift on Fridays, 8 pm to 4 am. My second position was at the F Street House as an assistant chef. I worked with a team of cooks at the house of GW president Steven Knapp to prepare meals for the many events he hosted.

Both experiences taught me valuable lessons in improvisation, leadership and customer service. The fast paced environment of a kitchen paired with the watchful eye of hungry customers certainly made me categorize these positions as true "character builders."
