<br><br>
Class Council's mission was to build community within classes and throughout the entire GW community by hosting both educational and recreational events to bring students together and improve student life on campus.
<br>
After being a class representative for two years, I took on the role of VP of Marketing in which I was responsible for all social media and marketing of the org. Along with that, I coordinated the performance of of two of the largest student performance competitions and created a new flagship event, GW Lights. Aside from the wonderful memories, Class Council provided me a place outside of engineering to develop my leadership skills and bring my creativity to new levels.
