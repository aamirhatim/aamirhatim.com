		Currently a student, I am seeking professional opportunities in the engineering and robotics fields, specifically in mechanical, electrical and/or biomedical engineering. I try to make the most out of all the work I do, and I always like to have my next opportunity build off the one that came before. Over the years I have picked up skills in many areas of engineering including CAD, computer programming, 3D printing, technical writing, and consulting. I have been fortunate to be able to work with all kinds of people from so many different professions, allowing me to get a better picture of the fields I would like to work in for the future.

				<p>At FAST, I worked as both a consultant and a software developer, listening to the client's needs and delivering practical solutions with our software. I worked with the Returns team to create the 2016/2017 tax forms for the District of Columbia, taking the lead on making many of the online versions for DC's new Taxpayer Access Portal. In the last seven months of my job I worked on the Production Support team, responding to any issues that occurred in production and fixing them as soon as possible.
				<br><br>
				Most of my work was done using VB.NET and SQL. For more information about FAST, see their website <a href = "https://www.fastenterprises.com/" target="_blank">here.</a>

				<p>The GW Nanomedicine and Tissue Engineering Lab applies a range of interdisciplinary technologies and approaches in nanotechnology, 3D nano/microfabrication, tissue engineering, stem cells, drug delivery and biomechanics to create biologically inspired complex tissue scaffolds and investigate their efficacy for healing complex tissues in vitro and in vivo.
				<br><br>
				As a research assistant, I worked with graduate and PhD students studying stem cell behavior on man-made cell scaffolds. My main responsibility was to create these scaffolds using a resin based 3D printer and CAD software (Rhino). I also built a new printing tray to print moe consistent scaffolds for testing.

				<p>An innovative spinal prosthetic company, Spine Wave was my first real-life look into biomedical engineering. As an R & D intern, I was responsible for building a product prototype used for marketing purposes, and also assisting the reset of the R&D staff with cataloging product designs. Over the course of the summer, I became proficient in SolidWorks, reading technical documentation, building basic electronic circuits, experimenting with Arduino, and working a few basic machine shop tools.

				<p>Often times you learn some invaluable lessons from the jobs you took just to make some pocket money. From cooking crepes at 4:00 am on Friday nights to being a help desk worker in an empty library, I have been faced with extremely difficult customers, long periods of idle time, questionable business practices, extreme time management, and improvisation. I have used all of these experiences to help me in my other careers and they have prepared me well for working with a team and knowing how to react in many different situations.
