  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    What started out as a curiosity project soon became what I thought was a necessity. Rather than updating a paper resume and periodically throwing it at whoever may glance my way, building a website could instead serve as a dynamic resume where I can show my skills and creativity through a brand new medium.
    <br><br>
    I debated using pre-made templates for their ease of use and clean looks on different sized screens, but I had a desire to learn the basics of web development from the ground up. I quickly became hooked, spiking my interests in graphic design and aesthetics of digital art.

  <h2>Current Version</h2>
  <h3>Version 5 - Getting Cozy with PHP</h3>
  <p>
    This version is clean on the inside and out. Previous versions of my site were not modular whatsoever. Redundant code, different standards, it was hard to maintain. For Version 5 I wanted to change that. I made extensive use of PHP, plugging in reusable code via server-side commands rather than re-typing it for every new page. I also simplified adding new pages by setting up text file parsing for an overall easier experience rather than unnecessarily getting too deep in the weeds of HTML.

  <h2>Previous Versions</h2>
  <p>
    Every once in a while I decide to scrap my current design and start from scratch again. Every time I learn something new, and I refine my tastes in web design. Check out previous versions of my site below.

    NOTE: These versions are no longer maintained, so there may be some parts and features missing!
