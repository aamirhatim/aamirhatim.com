        <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
        <p>
          What started out as a curiosity project soon became what I thought was a necessity. Rather than updating a paper resume and periodically throwing it at whoever may glance my way, building a website could instead serve as a dynamic resume where I can show my skills and creativity through a brand new medium.
          <br><br>
          I debated using pre-made templates for their ease of use and clean looks on different sized screens, but I had a desire to learn the basics of web development from the ground up. I quickly became hooked, spiking my interests in graphic design and aesthetics of digital art.

        <h4>PREVIOUS VERSIONS</h4>
        <p>
          Every once in a while I decide to scrap my current design and start from scratch again. Every time I learn something new, and I refine my tastes in web design. Check out previous versions of my site below. (Disclaimer: many of the links and features within these sites may no longer work as they are not maintained.)
