            I was always the builder (and destroyer) in my family, taking things apart to see how they worked and then attempting to piece everything back together. It was riveting, and I couldn't stop doing it. As I got older that excitement grew with me, but college was when I really began to steer that passion in a professional direction. I developed my multidisciplinary interests through biomedical engineering, learning about the incredible creative power of the fundamentals of engineering while exploring other related topics in biophysics and computer programming.
            <br><br>
            Now pursuing my Masters degree in Robotics, I want to take my skills and channel them into a career in which I can join fellow engineers, researchers and scientists to deliver world changing solutions in an ever-changing digital environment. Over the years I've been continuously refining my goals, both professionally and personally, and I've come to realize that they overlap in wonderful ways.
