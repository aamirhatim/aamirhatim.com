        I was always the builder (and destroyer) in my family, taking things apart to see how they worked and then attempting to piece everything back together. It was riveting, and I couldn't stop doing it. As I got older that excitement grew with me, but college was when I really began to steer that passion in a professional direction. I developed my multidisciplinary interests through biomedical engineering, learning about the incredible creative power of the fundamentals of engineering while exploring other related topics in biophysics and computer programming.

        Now equipped with a BS in Biomedical Engineering and a MS in Robotics, I want to take my skills and channel them into a career in which I can join fellow engineers, researchers and scientists to deliver world changing solutions in an ever-changing digital environment. Over the years I've been continuously refining my goals, both professionally and personally, and I've come to realize that they overlap in wonderful ways.
