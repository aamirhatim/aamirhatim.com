    For my capstone design project, two other engineering students and I partnered to develop <span class = "emphasize">Techtiles - a washable biometric shirt</span> that could measure breathing rate, heart rate, steps, distance and energy burned. The data from the shirt was wirelessly sent to a mobile app. Techtiles won second place and recognition for being the most marketable at GW's Pelton Senior Design competition, a showcase of the most notable engineering capstone projects of the year.

    My primary task was to develop all the hardware for the device. This included designing the sensors, creating a custom circuit board, 3D printing the housing for the processor and battery, and choosing the fabric for the shirt. I also assisted my teammates in creating the biometric algorithms for our sensors. After spending nearly a year on this project, I had become proficient with AutoCAD, Eagle, PSPICE, Matlab and the Arduino IDE. We were able to make the shirt washable by using silver coated nylon fabric for two of our sensors, the respiration sensor and a basic 3 lead electrocardiogram.
