	Ever since I returned from my study abroad program in the wonderful city of Istanbul, I fell in love with photography. What started out as simple entertainment from getting that perfect postcard shot quickly transformed into something so much more. I learned that by capturing the right shot I can capture the viewer, bringing them into a different world in which they can immerse themselves in, even for just a moment.

	I'm constantly experimenting with different methods; <span class = "emphasize">I believe that it's the best way to grow and find my own style</span>. My shots have been featured by companies like Google and Ariva, travel blogs, art galleries and various other photo competitions and I am always open to collaborate and start something new.
