			I feel fortunate that I found my passion early in college. Entering GW as a student in the arts and sciences school, I quickly found my niche in their engineering school instead and transferred. From there, I dove in headfirst into circuit theory, physics, and computer programming.
			<br><br>
			Currently a Masters candidate at Northwestern, I'm building off what I learned at GW, covering concepts like robotic manipulation, embedded systems, human-compter interaction and artificial intelligence.

					After spending two years working in software development and consulting, I wanted to further my technical skills in engineering. Drawn by the current breakthroughs in <span class = "emphasize">robotics</span> and <span class = "emphasize">artificial intelligence</span>, I joined the <span class = "emphasize">MSR Program</span> at Northwestern so I could pursue a career that explores these fields.
					<br><br>
					Currently, I am studying the fundamentals of robotic control and design. Later this year I plan on taking courses in machine learning and advanced robotics and mechatronics.

					For four years I was fortunate to call The George Washington University my school, my home and my life. As a part of the <span class = "emphasize">Honors Program</span> I took courses in philosophy and literature to develop my speaking, writing and critical thinking skills which I could effectively integrate into my engineering curriculum and my capstone senior design project.
					<br><br>
					Eager to volunteer my free time, I was heavily involved in a number of extra curricular programs. My most meaningful was serving the GW community as a member of <span class = "emphasize">GW Class Council</span>, a student government organization that focused on enriching student life and defining what it meant to be a Colonial.
					<br><br>
					I'm a strong believer in travel as a source of education and inspiration. My junior year I spent four months at <span class = "emphasize">Boğaziçi University</span>, one of the top universities in Turkey, studying electrical engineering and experiencing a whole new way of life.
